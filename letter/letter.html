        Dear Kaitlyn,
        <br />I wish for you to know how much I love you. <br />So I am sending
        you this letter, I hope it reaches you well. <br />To show my love, I
        will create am acrostic.
        <br />
        <br />Kaitlyn is the woman I choose to marry. <br />Any other fails to
        compare to her. <br />I yearn for the long years we choose to spend with
        each other. <br />The day nears when I will get to declare my commitment
        before many others. <br />Lovingly I will hold her the rest of our days
        here in this life. <br />Young we are now, and old we will become, but
        the whole time I will be hers. <br />Never before was there a girl I
        wanted to be with like Kaitlyn.
        <br />
        <br />Your loving fiance, <br />James
      </p>
