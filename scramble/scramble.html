                The word at the top is a random word at least 8 letters (possibly more)<br>
                and it's all scrambled up!<br><br>
                Can you unscramble it? Find the correct order to the letters and submit your guess!<br>
                You'll be awarded 5 points for unscrambling it,<br>
                and the letters above will take the correct order.<br><br>
                Additionaly you can use the letters to make any word!<br>
                You don't have to use all the letters, even just two letters, if its a word you can score 1 point!<br><br>
                Having trouble unscrambling? need a hint?<br>
                For the low cost of 2 points you can get a hint and it will reveal the placement of one letter.<br><br>
                You can attempt the daily word which is the same for everyone and compare with your friends!<br>
                Or hit random word to just play any random words!
